# Repo Quality

**What it measures:** The number of repositories (with a minimum star count) where you've had PRs successfully merged.

**Why it matters:** Contributing to established, popular repositories demonstrates that you can meet higher quality
standards and work with larger communities. It helps distinguish between genuine contributors and spam accounts.

**How it's calculated:** Count of unique repositories (meeting the minimum stars threshold) where you have merged PRs.
Default minimum is 100 stars, but this is configurable.

## How to Improve

- Contribute to well-maintained open source projects
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Build a track record with established projects
