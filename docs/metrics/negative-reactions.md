# Negative Reactions

**What it measures:** The total number of negative reactions (thumbs down, confused) received on your comments, issues,
and PR reviews.

**Why it matters:** A high number of negative reactions may indicate problematic behavior, unhelpful contributions, or
communication issues. This is a maximum threshold - you should stay below it.

**How it's calculated:** Sum of negative reaction types (thumbs down, confused) across your comments, issues, and PR
reviews.
