# Merger Diversity

**What it measures:** The number of unique maintainers who have merged the contributor's pull requests.

**Why it matters:** Having PRs merged by different maintainers across various projects demonstrates trust from the
community. Contributors who only self-merge their own PRs on their own repositories haven't demonstrated external trust.

**How it's calculated:** Count of unique GitHub users who merged the contributor's PRs. Self-merges on own repositories
are tracked separately.

## How to Improve

- Contribute to established projects where maintainers review and merge your work
- Build relationships with project maintainers
- Focus on quality contributions that get merged by others
