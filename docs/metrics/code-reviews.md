# Code Reviews

**What it measures:** The number of meaningful code reviews you've provided on other people's pull requests.

**Why it matters:** Providing code reviews demonstrates engagement with the community and technical understanding.
Reviewers who help others improve their code are valuable contributors. Spam accounts rarely engage in code review.

**How it's calculated:** Count of non-trivial review comments you've made on PRs (excluding your own PRs).

## How to Improve

- Review PRs in projects you're familiar with
- Provide constructive, helpful feedback
- Look for opportunities to help other contributors
- Share your knowledge and expertise
