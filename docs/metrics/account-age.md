# Account Age

**What it measures:** How long the GitHub account has existed (in days).

**Why it matters:** Very new accounts (< 30 days) submitting PRs may warrant additional scrutiny, as they're sometimes
associated with spam campaigns or AI-generated contributions. However, everyone starts somewhere, so this metric should
be used thoughtfully.

**How it's calculated:** Days between account creation date and current date.

## How to Improve

This metric improves naturally over time as your account ages.
