# Issue Engagement

**What it measures:** The number of issues you've created that received community engagement (comments from others).

**Why it matters:** Creating issues that spark discussion shows you're identifying real problems and communicating them
effectively. Engaged issues indicate thoughtful contributions rather than spam.

**How it's calculated:** Count of issues you've created that have at least one comment from another user.

## How to Improve

- Create well-researched, detailed issue reports
- Provide clear reproduction steps for bugs
- Propose thoughtful feature requests with use cases
