# Profile Completeness

**What it measures:** How complete the contributor's GitHub profile is (bio, company, followers, public repos).

**Why it matters:** A complete profile indicates a legitimate, invested GitHub user. Spam accounts typically have
minimal or no profile information.

**How it's calculated:** Score based on presence of bio (20 points), company (20 points), followers (up to 40 points),
and public repositories (up to 20 points).

## How to Improve

- Add a bio describing yourself and your interests
- Fill in your company or affiliation
- Engage with the community to gain followers
- Create and maintain public repositories
