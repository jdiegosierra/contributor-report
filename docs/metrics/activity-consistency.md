# Activity Consistency

**What it measures:** How regularly you're active on GitHub over the analysis period.

**Why it matters:** Consistent activity over time indicates a genuine contributor rather than a temporary or spam
account. Real developers typically have ongoing GitHub activity, while spam accounts often show sudden bursts of
activity.

**How it's calculated:** Percentage of months (within the analysis window) where you had at least one contribution (PR,
issue, or review).

## How to Improve

- Contribute regularly to projects you care about
- Maintain consistent involvement over time
- Even small contributions help demonstrate consistency
