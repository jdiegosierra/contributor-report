# PR Merge Rate

**What it measures:** The percentage of pull requests that get successfully merged versus those that are closed without
merging.

**Why it matters:** A low merge rate may indicate low-quality contributions, PRs that don't follow project guidelines,
or spam submissions. Contributors with consistently merged PRs demonstrate they understand project requirements and
deliver valuable contributions.

**How it's calculated:** (Merged PRs / Total PRs) × 100. Only PRs from the configured analysis window are considered.

## How to Improve

- Review contribution guidelines before submitting PRs
- Start with smaller, focused changes
- Respond to review feedback promptly
- Ensure tests pass before submitting
